# Snake Game Simulation

This python project combines object oriented programming, random walking movement, cellular automata in a single survival of the fittest simulation. 

This project simulated random snakes moving around on a 2d lattice. Food is randomly spread around on the board based on cellular automation. As the snakes move across the board and "eat" food, they grow longer. The simulation ends when a single snake is left moving around.
